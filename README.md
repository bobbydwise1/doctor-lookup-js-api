# _{Doctor Lookup}_

#### _{A web application that asks a user about a medical issue and returns a list of doctors using a real-world medical doctors API.}_

#### By _**{Robert Lee}**_

## Description

_{This program requires the use of the BetterDoctorAPI:

https://developer.betterdoctor.com/

  You will need to get your own API key for this project.

The application must do the following:

* A user should be able to enter a medical issue to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.
* A user should be able to to enter a name to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.
* If the query response includes any doctors, the following information should be included about each doctor: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients (the API provides this data).
* If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification that states what the error is.
* If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria. (This is not an error so it should be handled separately from any errors.)

  }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the project files from the associated Github repository._

* _Navigate to the root directory of the project, and type $ npm install.  Node Package Manager will begin installing all required dependencies.

* _Place your token in an .env file at the top level of your directory._
* _Include .env in .gitignore._
* _Use at least two JavaScript files: One to receive form input and another to make an API request and display results._
* _This example assumes your API Key is stored in an apiKey variable, as described in this lesson. In order to make your applications quick to grade, please follow the example exactly and do not rename your apiKey variable to something different._

* _Consult the BetterDoctor API documentation for further requirements if necessary._
